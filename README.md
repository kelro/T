# Description
I monitor temperature using 433 MHz wireless signals which are collected from battery operated sensors. I use a software defined radio dongle to decode the signals on a Linux laptop. If I loose utility power the laptop battery keeps everyhting running for a long time. The laptop and dongle consume 14 watts/hour.
