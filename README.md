Temperature

Synopsis

I monitor temperature using 433 MHz wireless signals collected from battery operated sensors. I use a software defined radio dongle to decode the signals on a Linux laptop. If I loose utility power the laptop battery keeps it up for a long time. The laptop and dongle draw 14 watts/hour.
